# Quantum Network Research Project

## Overview

This project investigates quantum phenomena in networked systems, building on recent breakthroughs in quantum teleportation over conventional internet infrastructure. Our interactive visualization demonstrates the layered architecture approach to quantum network research.

**Live Demo:** [diannt.net](https://diannt.net/)

## Key Quantum Phenomena Explored

1. **Quantum Teleportation**: State transfer between spatially separated systems
2. **Temporal Information Effects**: Correlation patterns that exhibit temporal anomalies
3. **Information Clustering**: Emergence of coherent information structures across network nodes

## Project Architecture

Our research platform is built on a five-layer architecture:

1. **Physical Infrastructure Layer**: Fiber optic networks, biometric devices, and computing hardware
2. **Quantum-Classical Network Layer**: Quantum channels, classical channels, and network monitoring
3. **Quantum Information Processing Layer**: Teleportation, temporal effects, and clustering modules
4. **Analysis and Correlation Layer**: Entanglement analysis, biometric correlation, and pattern detection
5. **Visualization and Interface Layer**: Quantum state visualization, correlation dashboards, and real-time monitoring

## Interactive Visualization

The project features an interactive network visualization that allows exploration of the system architecture. Click on any node to view detailed information about each component.

## Recent Research Foundation

This work builds upon Northwestern University's groundbreaking 2024 demonstration of quantum teleportation over conventional fiber optic cables carrying regular internet traffic. Our research extends this breakthrough by investigating temporal effects and information clustering phenomena that emerge in quantum-classical hybrid networks.
